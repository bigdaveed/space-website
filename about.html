        <h2>What You Need To Know</h2>
        The following outline is provided as an overview and topical guide to space science-filed that encompasses all of the scientific disciplines that involve space exploration and study natural phenomena and physical bodies occurring in outer space, such as space medicines and astrobiology.
        <br>
        <p>
            We work with <abbr title="The National Aeronutics and Space Administration">NASA.</abbr> This an independent agency of tyhe U.S. federal gorvernment responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research. Established in 1958, <abbr title="The National Aeronutics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> succeeded the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to give the U.S. space for development effort a distinctly civillian orientation, emphasizing peacful application in space science.

            <h2>The Exploration Program</h2>
            <p>
                We are also on team with <abbr title="The National Aeronutics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> during the 1968-1972 <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/apollo/about-apollo-7-the-first-crewed-apollo-space-mission/">Apollo Moon Landing</a> the mission that sent 12 humans to the surface of the moon, a total of 6 spacecraft carrying 12 astronauts landed on the lunar surrface. it was the only time humans have ever walked on another celestial body, and non have left Earth orbit since. The moon mission lasted for 8 days, 3 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.
            </p>
                <br>
                    The primary objective of the Apollo mission was to complete a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961: perform a crew lunar landing amd return to Eath.

                        The first human to ever step feet on the moon was Neil Armstrong he was the commander of the Apollo mission, he has flew on two spaace mission one was the Apollo moon landing and he waas also an engineer, a pilot and a collage profssor. He has worked for <abbr title="The National Aeronutics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> for so long and he is well recognize we have every reason to belive that he was the main character on the moon landing mission. In 1962 Armstrong joined the space program with its second group of astronauts. On March 16, 1966, Armstrong, as command pilot of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/gemini-viii/">Gemini 8</a>, and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/people/dr-david-r-scott/">David R. Scott</a>.
